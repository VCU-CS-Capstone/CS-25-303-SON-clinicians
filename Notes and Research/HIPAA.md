# HIPAA Compliance Overview

HIPAA Compliance is not solely a developer’s responsibility. It requires collaboration across development, operations, security, and administrative staff. Proper server configuration, internal policies, and responsible actions by all personnel are essential.

This document outlines **developer responsibilities** for contributing to HIPAA Compliance.

> **Note:** This is not an exhaustive compliance guide. Full HIPAA compliance involves legal, administrative, and procedural requirements beyond the scope of this document.

## Terms and Definitions

- **ePHI**: Electronic Protected Health Information — any protected health information that is stored, accessed, transmitted, or received in electronic form.
- **Minimum Necessary Standard**: The principle of limiting ePHI access to the minimum required to perform job duties.
- **Audit Trail**: A secure log of access and changes to ePHI.
- **BAA**: Business Associate Agreement — a contract ensuring that third-party service providers meet HIPAA requirements.

## Software Design

Developer responsibilities to support HIPAA compliance in the application architecture.

### Data Logging

HIPAA requires maintaining audit trails of key activities involving ePHI. Data retention must meet the 6-year minimum.

- [x] All data changes involving ePHI must be logged.
- [x] All login attempts (successful and failed) must be logged.
- [x] Access to ePHI must be logged, including user ID and timestamp.
- [x] Audit logs must be tamper-evident and securely stored.

### Authentication & Access Control

Systems must ensure user accountability and restrict access based on job function.

- [x] Users must be automatically logged out after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes).
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user access.
- [x] Apply the principle of least privilege via granular permissions and role-based access controls (RBAC).
- [ ] Require strong password policies (length, complexity, rotation).

### Data Transmission & Storage

ePHI must be protected both in transit and at rest.

- [x] All ePHI must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2+ for transit).
- [ ] Ensure secure key management and rotation for encryption keys.
- [ ] Avoid storing ePHI on client devices when not absolutely necessary.

### Integrity & Availability

Data must remain accurate, and systems must remain resilient.

- [x] Implement input validation to prevent data corruption.
- [x] Include system health checks and backup verification routines.
- [ ] Ensure regular, encrypted backups of ePHI and configurations.

## Server Requirements

Server infrastructure must be configured to meet HIPAA's physical and technical safeguards.

### Storage & Encryption

- [ ] Full disk encryption on all servers handling ePHI.
- [ ] Encryption of virtual disks and volumes (e.g., LUKS, BitLocker).
- [ ] Encryption of sensitive files and directories.
- [ ] Secure and restricted access to decryption keys.

### Infrastructure & Operations

- [ ] Servers must reside in physically secure, access-controlled data centers.
- [ ] Enable automatic security updates and patch management.
- [ ] Configure firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- [ ] Limit administrative access via VPN or bastion host, using MFA.

### Monitoring & Auditing

- [ ] Centralized logging with alerting for suspicious activity.
- [ ] Routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
- [ ] Annual HIPAA security assessments and documentation review.

## Final Notes

- Always document implementation decisions and store change history.
- Ensure all third-party tools or platforms used for handling ePHI have signed **BAAs**.
- Developers should undergo HIPAA security awareness training if they have access to ePHI or related systems.
