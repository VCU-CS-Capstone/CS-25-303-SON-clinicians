# Documentation

This folder contains high-level documentation for the CS 25 303 Backend/API project.

While code-level comments and file-specific notes can be found throughout the repository, this directory serves as a centralized reference for understanding the system as a whole. It is designed to help:

- New developers onboard quickly
- Reviewers or stakeholders understand the project structure
- Support the continuation of work beyond the academic timeline
