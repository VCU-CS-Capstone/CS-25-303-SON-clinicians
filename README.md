# Tablet-Based Clinical Support Application

## Virginia Commonwealth University – School of Nursing

### Overview

This project is a **tablet-based application prototype** developed in collaboration with the VCU School of Nursing's Mobile Health & Welfare Program. It is designed to assist clinicians in **preparing for patient consultations** by providing a streamlined summary of prior patient survey responses. The application aims to enhance patient care by promoting **data-informed clinical decision-making** in a fast-paced healthcare environment.

> This repository serves as the central hub for all documentation, code, and resources related to the development, implementation, and delivery of the project.

### 🩺 Project Purpose

Clinicians often operate under time constraints and need to rapidly contextualize patient history. This application enables healthcare providers to:

- **Quickly review a patient’s survey data** prior to consultation.
- Identify trends or patterns in patient responses.
- Access relevant information in a format optimized for tablet-based workflows.

The goal is to improve clinician readiness, encourage continuity of care, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes.

### ✅ Project Achievements

- Successfully delivered a functional **React Native prototype** for iPad devices.
- Demonstrated proof of concept to the VCU School of Nursing; the project exceeded expectations and led to internal interest in expanding it to a **production-grade solution**.
- Secured additional funding consideration based on the impact and usability of the initial prototype.
- Built with a modular architecture to support future clinical features and potential integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems.
