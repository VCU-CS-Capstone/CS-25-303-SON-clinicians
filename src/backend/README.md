## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Development Environment

### 1. Install Rust

Follow the official instructions:  
üîó [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Windows-Specific Note

To build dependencies like `aws-lc-rs`, you may need the C++ Build Tools.  
We recommend using [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to install them.

#### AWS-LC-RS Build Requirements

This project uses [`aws-lc-rs`](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/). Make sure to follow their [setup instructions](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/index.html) to install the necessary build tooling (e.g., Perl, NASM, CMake).

### 2. Set Up a PostgreSQL Database

We recommend using Docker to quickly spin up a local PostgreSQL instance:

üîó [Official Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Basic Docker command (example):

```bash
docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
